### Hi there 👋, Computer and Mobile Networks - Stop & Wait protocol for UDP
![](https://arturssmirnovs.github.io/github-profile-readme-generator/images/banner.png)

Functions
● My program sets and closes sessions of communication
● It is a simple STOP and WAIT protocol for UDP
● In the packet, the byte payload includes both the original data and a
sequence number for the packet (SN=x)
● The data in the file is sent between the client/server and contains the
string ‘umbrella’
● Included are UDP ports for the communication endpoints
● The client takes an IP address/Hostname and port number as
arguments
● The port number is the port number the server listens on
● The sender reads a line of data from the file and combines that text
with the sequence number and sends the packet to the receiver.

Outputs
My system outpus to the command console clear statements to demonstrate
the interactions and functionality.

Technical Requirements
