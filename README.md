<h1>Computer and Mobile Networks - Stop & Wait protocol for UDP</h1>


<h2>Functions</h2>

<body> ● My program sets and closes sessions of communication

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>

● It is a simple STOP and WAIT protocol for UDP

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>

● In the packet, the byte payload includes both the original data and a sequence number for the packet (SN=x) 

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
  
● The data in the file is sent between the client/server and contains the string ‘umbrella’ 

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
  
● Included are UDP ports for the communication endpoints 

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
  
● The client takes an IP address/Hostname and port number as arguments 

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>

● The port number is the port number the server listens on 

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>

● The sender reads a line of data from the file and combines that text with the sequence number and sends the packet to the receiver. </body>
