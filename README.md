<h1>Computer and Mobile Networks - Stop & Wait protocol for UDP</h1>


<h2>Functions</h2>

<body> ● My program sets and closes sessions of communication
● It is a simple STOP and WAIT protocol for UDP
● In the packet, the byte payload includes both the original data and a
sequence number for the packet (SN=x)
● The data in the file is sent between the client/server and contains the
string ‘umbrella’
● Included are UDP ports for the communication endpoints
● The client takes an IP address/Hostname and port number as
arguments
● The port number is the port number the server listens on
● The sender reads a line of data from the file and combines that text
with the sequence number and sends the packet to the receiver.
